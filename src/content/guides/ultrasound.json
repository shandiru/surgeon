It does not use radiation, so it’s considered very safe, and it allows the clinician to view pelvic organs live during the scan. This makes it a key diagnostic tool for assessing and monitoring many gynaecological conditions."

It can also help identify cysts, fibroids, or other abnormalities, and in some cases, the fallopian tubes may be visible if they are enlarged or contain fluid."
